Terms of Service for AdminBot
1. Acceptance of Terms
By using AdminBot ("the Bot") on your Discord server, you agree to the following Terms of Service ("Terms"). These Terms apply to all users and administrators who interact with the Bot, and by adding the Bot to your server, you acknowledge and accept these terms.

2. Self-Hosting Requirement
AdminBot is a self-hosted bot, meaning you must host the Bot and its associated scripts on your own server or hosting provider. The entire source code, including all features and configurations, is provided to you freely under the MIT License. You are responsible for ensuring that the Bot is hosted and configured properly on your server.
Server Requirements: You must have a suitable environment (e.g., a VPS, dedicated server, or cloud hosting) capable of running the Bot, and it must meet the technical specifications listed in the Bot’s documentation.
Self-Management: As the user, you are responsible for managing the hosting environment, ensuring that the Bot remains online and functional, and troubleshooting any issues related to the hosting or functionality of the Bot.

3. Usage of the Bot
AdminBot provides a variety of moderation, server management, and customization features. You agree to use the Bot solely for legitimate and authorized purposes and not to use it to:
 - Violate Discord’s Terms of Service or any applicable laws.
 - Harass, abuse, or otherwise harm other users.
 - Spam, flood, or disrupt the service in any way.

4. Privacy and Data Collection
AdminBot does not collect personal data unless explicitly specified in the Bot's functionality.
The Bot logs actions like server bans, kicks, and mutes to improve moderation and assist with server management.
All logs are stored according to the server owner’s settings and may be sent to designated webhooks or storage locations.
AdminBot does not share any personal or sensitive information without the consent of the user.

6. Support and Updates
Self-Hosting Support: As a self-hosted product, AdminBot’s support is limited to the official documentation, community support (e.g., Discord server), and occasional bug fixes. You are responsible for managing updates and ensuring compatibility with your hosting environment.
Updates: The Bot's source code may be updated periodically, and you are responsible for manually updating your hosted instance to take advantage of new features or bug fixes.

8. Limitation of Liability
AdminBot is provided "as is," and the creators or administrators of the Bot are not responsible for any damages, losses, or issues caused by the use of the Bot, including but not limited to loss of data, downtime, or server disruptions. Since the Bot is self-hosted, we are not liable for any issues related to your hosting environment or setup.

9. Modifications to the Terms
The creators of AdminBot reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. Any changes to the Terms will be communicated through the official channels, and your continued use of the Bot after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.

10. Termination of Service
The Bot’s service may be terminated or suspended at any time, for any reason, without prior notice. You may also choose to remove the Bot from your server at any time.

11. Contact Information
If you have any questions or concerns regarding these Terms of Service, you can contact the AdminBot team through the official support channels (e.g., Discord support server or support email).
